# Perseverance and Ingenuity Tracker REST API
## Purpose

In 2020 NASA sent a Mars rover, Perseverance, and a robotic helicopter, Ingenuity, to explore Mars and its habitability. NASA funded this project to achieve four main objectives: determine if there was life on Mars at some point, characterize past and current climate, characterize the geology of Mars, and prepare for human exploration. It has been nearly three years and thus a lot of data has been collected. 

Combining information from both Perseverance and Ingenuity's datasets could potentially yield a richer set of information. However, it is currently very difficult to work with two large and seperate datasets. Through this project we seek to close the gap by being able to emphasize areas where the datasets overlap. While we do not have access the data collected by the two robots, we hope that researchers can build upon this app in order to make important discoveries regarding Mars and its habitability. Furthermore, this project shows the potential that can result from the synchronization of data from various robots when studying an unknown environment. 

## Data 

The public [data](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/) is maintained and provided by NASA. It provides real-time location of both Perseverance and Ingenuity. The website also provides other information regarding rock samples, waypoints, oaths, and more. For this project we are only using the rover path and helicopter flight path. The rover path data consist of sols, clock, and latitude/logitude coordinates. The helicopter path data consist of sols, flight, clock, and latitude/longitude/altitude coordinates.
